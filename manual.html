    <h2>2. Train Driving Basics</h2>

    <p>Typically a train consists of 5 wagons, which can total up to over 167,000 kg in mass. Keep
    the train length and in mass when driving it. A train possesses considerable
    inertia even when empty.</p>

    <p>The subway driver must pay attention and act according to track signals, track
    signs and dispatcher instructions to ensure efficient and safe operation of the
    train.</p>

    <p>The trains use rheostat control for starting and braking (Em, Ema508), thyristor control
    for braking (81-717, Ema509). It takes some time for rheostat to spin into the right position.
    Try to get a good feeling of this delay.</a>

    <div><p>To avoid damage to the engines and discomfort of the passengers, the current through
    engines is limited. Effective acceleration and braking of train is <b>1.5 m/s2</b>.</p></div>


    <h3>Electric System</h3>

    <p>The train electric circuits are divided into <i>auxiliary</i> circuits, <i>power</i> circuits and
    <i>control</i> circuits. There are four electric engines, two engines in each bogey - connected in
    series (engines #1 and #3, engines #2 and #4). The two pairs of engines can be in turn connected
    in series or in parallel.</p>

    <p>Each engine consists of an anchor (a rotor) and a stator. All subway trains described in
    this manual use series excitation of engine. This means that current flows through anchor,
    then flows through stator.</p>

    <p>Current through stator will create a magnetic field, in which the anchor will rotate.
    The rotation of anchor generates current in opposite of current which accelerates it.
    When current that flows through the engine equals counter-current generated by the engines,
    train stops accelerating. This is known as <b>automatic mode</b>.</p>

    <p>During the initial start of the train, there is no magnetic field available and so
    no counter-current is generated. If engines would be connected in series to the 750 volts
    power source, the total current flowing through them would be
    <b>(750 volts) / (4 * 0.0691 ohm) = 2710 A</b>. Such current would destroy the engines.</p>

    <p>To limit the current flowing through engines during startup a rheostat is used. It
    adds additional resistance to the power circuits, limiting the current to <b>240-260 A</b>
    for an empty train, and up to <b>310-340 A</b> on slopes and under load</p>

    <p>Acceleration of the train depends on current through the anchor. Rotation rate is
    dependant on current through the stator (which is usually equal to current through the anchor).</p>


    <h3>Control System</h3>
    <p>When trains are coupled together mechanically, the electric ports located on the coupling
    are connected too. Each of the pins creates a <b>train wire</b>, single conductor which is shared
    by all the wagons of the train.</p>
    
    <p>Train wires are used to transmit control signals to all of the wagons of the train.</p>
    
    <p><b>Sbor</b> - assembly of the power circuits, all the relays close and create a specific
    circuit for braking or acceleration. <b>Razbor</b> - opposite process, circuits are disconnected
    and disassembled by opening relays and contactors.</p>



    <h3>Pneumatic System</h3>
    <p>Pressure in brake cylinders is defined by difference of pressure between brake line
    and train line/reservoir. To increase pressure in brake cylinder, brake line pressure
    must be released.</p>

    <p>The pneumatic system is shared across all of the trains wagons. This is controlled
    by the <b>isolation valves</b>. These valves allow connection of brake line and train line
    through the coupling.</p>

    <div><p>Make sure that isolation valves on both ends of the train are <b>CLOSED</b>, while
    all the isolation valves between wagons are <b>OPEN</b>. Closed valves will prevent
    operation of the pneumatic system across entire train and will decrease braking efficiency.</p></div>



    <h3>Train Controls</h3>

    <p>The main instrument of a driver is the controller handle. It controls the way in which
    electric circuits of the train will be connected. The second instrument is the drivers valve,
    which allows contorol over the pneumatic system of the train.</p>

    <p>Direction of train movement is selected by the reverser. Reverser is an additional
    rotor which coincides with the controller and has three positions: forward, <b>0</b>, backward.</p>

    <div><p>Only one wagon in the train can have reverser set to forward. Right now you have
    to pay extra attention to make sure of that.</p></div>

    <p>The controller occupies one of the following seven positions:</p>

    <table>
    <tr><td>X3</td><td> Engines connected in parallel</td></tr>
    <tr><td>X2</td><td> Engines connected in series</td></tr>
    <tr><td>X1</td><td> Manuvering mode</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>0</b></td> <td>All engines disconnected</td></tr>
    <tr><td>T1</td><td> Manual braking (electric brakes engaged)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>T1A</td><td>Manual braking (removes a step of resistance from the rheostat)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>T2</td><td> Automatic braking/full stop mode</td></tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <p>The drivers valve controls pneumatic system state and has five different positions:</P>
    <table>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Charge (fast release) </td><td>Brake line is filled from train line</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Driving (brake release)</td><td>Brake line and reservoir filled from train line</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Closed                 </td><td>All valves are closed, drivers valve is disabled (no flow)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Service application    </td><td>Brake line is released to atmosphere, brake cylinders fed from train line</td></tr>
    <tr><td>5</td><td>Emergency application  </td><td>Fast application of brakes</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Normal pneumatic braking involves moving drivers valve from position 2 to
    position 4 until desired pressure in brake line is reached. Full application
    of brakes equals to 3 atm of pressure in brake line. Releasing brakes is
    done by moving the valve to position 2 (driving).</p>
    
    <p>The head train must have pneumatic valve in position 2 for normal driving
    to avoid overcharging. Intermediate and rear trains must all have driver
    valve disabled by setting it to position 3.</p>
    
    <div><p>Do not leave drivers valve in the position 1 (charge) for
    longer than needed to avoid overcharging of the brake line.</p></div>


    <h2>3. Train Controller Modes</h2>

    <h3>X1 (Manuvering)</h3>
    <div><p>To avoid overheating of the resistors, limit duration of operating in
    the X1 mode to no more than 3 minutes.</p></div>

    <h3>X2 (Series)</h3>
    <h3>X3 (Parallel)</h3>
    <div><p>Once X3 mode is engaged, the train will stay in it even if controller
    is moved to X2 or X1.</p></div>

    <h3>T1 (Manual brake)</h3>
    <h3>T1A (Manual brake, next rheostat position)</h3>
    <div><p>To remove a single position from rheostat and increase strength of brakes by
    one step, cycle controller between T1 and T1A. Repeat until desired braking efficiency
    is reached.</p></div>
    
    <p>Typically you would brake to 20 kph by alternating between T1 and T1A, then engage T2 for full stop.</p>

    <h3>T2 (Automatic brake)</h3>
    <div><p>When rheostat reaches position 17, pneumatic valve #1 will be open and
    pneumatic brakes will be applied.</p></div>

    <div><p>In the T2 mode, if electric brakes do not gain enough efficiency, they will be
    replaced by pneumatic braking.</p></div>


    <h2>4. Troubleshooting for Dummies</h2>
    <h3>Train refuses to move</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Is one RP light glowing? Check every wagon until you find one with two RP lights glowing.</li>
      <li>Are two RP lights glowing? Press G to return overload relay.</li>
      <li>Are pneumatic brakes engaged? Release brakes by pressing R</li>
      <li>Is reverser set to neutral in all wagons? Reset reverser to neutral position in all wagons.</li>
      <li>Try cycling reverser between forward and backward position</li>
      <li>Try cycling controller between X1 and 0 positions <i>with pneumatic brakes engaged</i></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pneumatic brakes do not engage or do not release</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Check all isolation valves.</li>
      <li>Make sure isolation valves on train ends are <b>CLOSED</b></li>
      <li><b>OPEN</b> isolation valves between trains. Make sure to open them on both ends of the coupling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Electric brakes don't work or are not efficient</h3>
    <ol>
