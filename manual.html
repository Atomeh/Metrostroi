	<h2><a id="introduction" href="#introduction">1. Introduction to Your Train</a></h2>

	<p>
	You are in control of a state-of-the-art subway train.
	It features electric engines as well as pneumatic and electric braking systems. The electric circuitry is primarily based on mechanical relays.
	Internally, the electrical systems are controlled by opening and closing contactors in order to reconfigure the train's circuitry.
	For example, the motors can be connected in either series or parallel depending on the required speed.
	</p>

	<p>
	In normal usage, there are few controls that the driver needs to use. These are:
	</p>

	<h3>The Controller</h3>

	<p>
	Control of the electric power circuits is mainly done through the <em>controller</em> - by setting the
	controller to one of seven different modes, the motors can be disengaged or configured to run at
	three different speeds, and the electric brakes can be set to the desired strength.
	</p>

	<h3>The Driver's Valve</h3>

	<p>
	The pneumatic braking system is controlled with the <em>driver's valve</em>.
	It has five modes, which allow the brake cylinder to be filled or drained of air.
	The subway trains use fail-safe westinghouse braking system (railway air brake).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The valve is used to connect or disconnect brake line and train line. For proper
	air braking, the valve is opened and closed until brake line pressure is at desired
	value.
	</p>

	<aside class="info"><p>
	Unlike the controller, there is no shortcut to immediately set driver's valve to a
	position, and must be stepped through manually to reach the desired mode.
	</p></aside>

	<h3>The Reverser</h3>

	<p>
	Trains cabin in every wagon, which can command direction in which train will move. The cabins at either
	end of the train are called heads. A <em>reverser</em> in every wagon controls the direction of movement for entire train.
	The reverser can be in three positions: <var>forward</var>, <var>0</var>, and <var>backward</var>. If reverser
	is in position <em>0</em> in a wagon, it will receive control commands from other wagons.
	</p>
	
	<aside class="info"><p>
	Most of the wagons control circuitry is only enabled when reverser is set to a non-zero position. Doors
	will not open/close with reverser in position zero.
	</p></aside>

	<h2><a id="driving" href="#driving">2. Train Driving Basics</a></h2>

	<section>
		<h3>Moving</h3>

		<p>
		To control the movement of the train, there are four relevant modes on the controller: <var>X1</var>, <var>X2</var>, <var>X3</var> and <var>0</var>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><var>X1</var> is a low-powered mode which is used for maneuvering in a depot or through track switches.</li>
			<li>
				<var>X2</var> and <var>X3</var> are the modes used for travelling between stations. <br />
					In <var>X2</var>/<var>X3</var>, the engines enter automatic mode and speed is automatically controlled - the counter-current generated by the engines will regulate the speed of the train.
				<ul>
					<li>In <var>X2</var> mode, the train has a top speed of roughly 40-50 km/h, which drops to 20-22 km/h when climbing a slope due to automatic mode.</li>
					<li>In <var>X3</var> mode, the train's top speed is roughly 80-90 km/h, which decreases to 60 km/h on a slope.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><var>0</var> disengages the engines and lets the train roll on the tracks.</li>
		</ul>

		<aside class="warning"><p>
		<var>X1</var> mode never removes resistors from power circuit and causes the resistors to heat up.
		To avoid overheating, do not operate in <var>X1</var> for more than 3-4 minutes.
		</p></aside>

		<aside class="info"><p>
		The power circuitry assembled for driving cannot be switched to a mode back.
		It is not possible to go from <var>X3</var> to <var>X1</var>, from <var>X3</var> to <var>X2</var>,
		and from <var>X2</var> to <var>X1</var> - 
		when the controller is in one of these positions, you must switch to <var>0</var> first.
		</p></aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Electric Brakes</h3>

		<p>
		The electric brakes are controlled by three controller modes: <var>T1</var>, <var>T1A</var> and <var>T2</var>.
		The electric brakes will be engaged upon selecting any of these modes.
		The brakes can be smoothly applied - switching from <var>T1</var> to <var>T1A</var> adds an extra level of brake strength.
		<var>T2</var> mode will attempt to keep a constant braking force by automatically adding levels of brake strength,
		which keeps the deceleration roughly constant throughout the entire braking.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="info"><p>
		Manual electric brakes (<var>T1</var> and <var>T1A</var>) are used only for decreasing speed or keeping
		it within limits on slopes. The brakes must be always engaged by the time train enters station.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		When <var>T2</var> is engaged, if the power circuits fail to assemble, pneumatic braking will be applied instead.
		While manual brake may take some time to assemble (<em><a href="#define-sbor">sbor</a></em>), <var>T2</var> brakes will become effective immediately to ensure safety of the train.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="warning"><p>
		Disengaging electric brakes on slopes is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong>. If for some reason electric
		brakes disengage, apply emergency pneumatic braking and proceed according to instructions.
		</p></aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pneumatic Brakes</h3>

		<p>
		The pneumatic braking system is controlled by the driver's valve.
		The pressure in the brake cylinders is controlled by the pressure difference between two lines -
		the <em>train line</em>, which has a large reservoir and a compressor motor attached, 
		and the <em>brake line</em>, which can be filled from the train line
		or released into the atmosphere as necessary to control the brakes.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="info"><p>
		If either of the air lines are severed or a couple between wagons fails, brake line will lose pressure
		instantly while train line will be pressurized for some more time. This will engage emergency brakes all
		of the train.
		</p></aside>
		
		<aside class="warning"><p>
		Always verify isolation valves (FIXME: add link to the term) positions before departing to ensure that
		pneumatic system is shared for entire train.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		When pneumatic braking is not used, the driver's valve is set to position <var>2</var>.
		This fills the brake line from the train line, which causes the two pressures to almost equalize, and so disengages the brakes.
		Mode <var>4</var> releases the pressure from the brake line into the atmosphere which causes
		the brake cylinders to fill from the train line, thus engaging the brakes.
		In mode <var>3</var>, all the valves are closed, which keeps the brake pressure as it is.
		<var>1</var> is similar to <var>2</var> and <var>5</var> is similar to <var>4</var>,
		except they take effect quicker, and the driver's valve must be held in that position.
		</p>
		
		<aside class="info"><p>
		To apply pneumatic brake, set drivers valve to position <var>3</var> to prepare the braking, and then open it
		by moving to position <var>4</var>, closing back with position <var>3</var>.
		</p></aside>
		
		<p>Pneumatic brakes are applied in steps, which the driver controls by the pressure gauge. There are three
		pneumatic braking steps (pressure is indicated by the red arrow on pressure gauges):</p>
		<table>
		<tr><td><var>6.2-6.5 atm</var></td><td>Brakes fully released and supercharged</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>4.8-5.2 atm</var></td><td>Brakes fully released</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>4.3 atm</var></td><td>Step 1</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>4.0 atm</var></td><td>Step 2</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>3.7 atm</var></td><td>Step 3</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>3.0 atm</var></td><td>Full service brake</td></tr>
		<tr><td><var>0.0 atm</var></td><td>Emergency brake</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		<aside class="warning"><p>
		When using pneumatic brakes, brake line pressure must be changed by at least <var>0.2</var> atmospheres,
		otherwise there will be no pressure gain in the braking cylinders.
		</p></aside>

		<aside class="warning"><p>
		The brake line will become overcharged if the driver's valve is held at position <var>1</var> for too long.
		</p></aside>
		
		<aside class="warning"><p>
		Drivers valve will only work when drivers valve disconnect valve is open. If drivers valve is open in more
		than one wagon, pneumatic braking efficiency will be very low.
		</p></aside>
		
		<aside class="info"><p>
		The braking force is proportional to pressure in brake cylinders, which can be read by a gauge with a <em>single</em>
		black arrow.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		When the electric brakes reach position #18, the pneumatic brakes will be automatically activated by
		turning on pneumatic valve #1 (which creates pressure in braking cylinders of <var>0.8-1.2 atm</var>).
		When using <var>T2</var> mode, this typically happens at roughly 5-10 km/h.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		If <var>T2</var> mode fails to engage, pneumatic valve #2 is turned on (which creates pressure of <var>1.5-2.0 atm</var>).

		<h3>Reversing direction</h3>

		<p>
		Each wagon has a <em>reverser</em>, which sets the direction that the train moves in.
		The	reverser has three positions - <var>forward</var>, <var>0</var> and <var>backward</var>.
		The	wagon that you wish to control the train should have its reverser set to <var>forward</var>, all others must be set to <var>backward</var>.

		</ol>

		<p>
		To avoid damage to the engines and discomfort of the passengers, the current through engines is limited.
		The effective acceleration and braking of train is 1.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>

		<aside class="info"><p>
		The trains use rheostat control for starting and braking (Em, Ema508), thyristor control for braking (81-717, Ema509).
		It takes some time for rheostat to spin into the right position.
		Try to get a good feeling of this delay.

	<section>
		<h3>Electric System</h3>
		<p>
		The train electric circuits are divided into <em>auxiliary</em> circuits, <em>power</em> circuits and <em>control</em> circuits.
		There are four electric engines, two engines in each bogie - with pairs connected in series (engines #1 and #3, engines #2 and #4) so both bogeys always produce power.
		The two pairs of engines can be in turn connected in series or in parallel.
		</p>

		<p>
		Each engine consists of an anchor (a rotor) and a stator.
		All subway trains described in this manual use series excitation of engine.
		This means that current flows through anchor, then flows through stator, as they are both connected in series.
		</p>

		<p>
		Current through stator will create a magnetic field, in which the anchor will rotate.
		The rotation of anchor generates current in opposite of current which accelerates it.
		When current that flows through the engine equals counter-current generated by the engines, the train stops accelerating.
		This is known as <strong>automatic mode</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		During the initial start of the train, there is no magnetic field available and so no counter-current is generated.
		If the engines would be connected in series to the 750 V power source, the total current flowing through them would be (750 V) / (4 * 0.0691 Ω) = 2710 A.
		Such a current would destroy the engines.
		To limit the current flowing through engines during startup a rheostat is used.
		It adds additional resistance to the power circuits, limiting the current to 240-260 A for an empty train,
		and up to 310-340 A on slopes and under load.
		</p>

		<p>
		Acceleration of the train depends on current through the anchor.
		Rotation rate is dependant on current through the stator (which is usually equal to current through the anchor).
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Control System</h3>

		<p>
		When trains are coupled together mechanically, the electric ports located on the coupling are connected too.
		Each of the pins creates a <strong>train wire</strong>, single conductor which is shared by all the wagons of the train.
		Train wires are used to transmit control signals to all of the wagons of the train.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pneumatic System</h3>

		<p>
		Pressure in brake cylinders is defined by difference of pressure between brake line and train line.
		To increase pressure in brake cylinder, pressure from brake line must be released.
		</p>

		<p>
		The pneumatic system is meant to be shared across all of the trains wagons.
		This is controlled by the <strong>isolation valves</strong>.
		These valves allow connection of brake line and train line through the coupling.
		The isolation valves on both uncoupled ends of the train should be closed, while all the isolation valves between wagons should be all open.
		Closed valves along the train will prevent operation of the pneumatic system across the entire train and will decreased braking efficiency.
