	<h2><a id="introduction" href="#introduction">1. Introduction to Your Train</a></h2>

	<p>
	You are in control of a state-of-the-art subway train.
	It features electric engines as well as pneumatic and electric braking systems.
	Internally, the electrical systems are controlled by opening and closing relays in order to reconfigure the train's circuitry.
	For example, the motors can be connected in either series or parallel depending on the required speed.
	</p>

	<p>
	In normal usage, there are few controls that the driver needs to use. These are:
	</p>

	<h3>The Controller</h3>

	<p>
	Control of the electric systems is primarily through the <em>controller</em> - by setting the
	controller to one of seven different modes, the motors can be disengaged or configured to run at
	three different speeds, and the electric brakes can be set to the desired strength.
	</p>

	<h3>The Driver's Valve</h3>

	<p>
	The pneumatic braking system is controlled with the <em>driver's valve</em>.
	It has five modes, which allow the brake cylinder to be filled or drained of air.
	</p>

	<aside class="info"><p>
	Unlike the controller, the driver's valve cannot be immediately set to a
	position, and must be stepped through manually to reach the desired mode.
	</p></aside>

	<h3>The Reverser</h3>

	<p>
	Trains have a head at each end to allow them to move in either direction along the track.
	The	<em>reverser</em> controls the direction of movement.
	The reverser can be in three positions: <var>forward</var>, <var>0</var>, and <var>backward</var>.
	</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2><a id="driving" href="#driving">2. Train Driving Basics</a></h2>

	<section>
		<h3>Moving</h3>

		<p>
		To control the movement of the train, there are four relevant modes on the controller: <var>X1</var>, <var>X2</var>, <var>X3</var> and <var>0</var>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><var>X1</var> is a low-powered mode which is used for maneuvering in a depot or through track switches.</li>
			<li>
				<var>X2</var> and <var>X3</var> are the modes used for travelling between stations. <br />
					In <var>X2</var>/<var>X3</var>, the engines enter automatic mode and speed is automatically controlled - the countercurrent generated by the engines will regulate the speed of the train.
				<ul>
					<li>In <var>X2</var> mode, the train has a top speed of roughly 40-50 km/h, which drops to 20-22 km/h when climbing a slope due to automatic mode.</li>
					<li>In <var>X3</var> mode, the train's top speed is roughly 80-90 km/h, which decreases to 60 km/h on a slope.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><var>0</var> disengages the engines and lets the train roll on the tracks.</li>
		</ul>

		<aside class="warning"><p>
		<var>X1</var> mode causes the resistors to heat up.
		To avoid overheating, do not operate in <var>X1</var> for more than 3 minutes.
		</p></aside>

		<aside class="info"><p>
		The circuitry cannot be directly switched from <var>X3</var> to <var>X1</var> or <var>X2</var> -
		when the controller is in is in <var>X3</var> position, you must switch	to <var>0</var> first.
		</p></aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Electric Brakes</h3>

		<p>
		The electric brakes are controller by three controller modes: <var>T1</var>, <var>T1A</var> and <var>T2</var>.
		The electric brakes are engaged in all of these modes.
		The brakes can be varied in strength - switching from <var>T1</var> to <var>T1A</var> adds an extra level of brake strength.
		<var>T2</var> mode will attempt to keep a constant braking force by automatically adding levels of brake strength,
		which keeps the deceleration roughly constant throughout the entire braking.
		</p>

		<p>
		When <var>T2</var> is engaged, if the power circuits fail to assemble, pneumatic braking will be applied instead.
		While manual brake may take some time to assemble (<em><a href="#define-sbor">sbor</a></em>), <var>T2</var> brakes will become effective immediately to ensure safety of the train.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pneumatic Brakes</h3>

		<p>
		The pneumatic braking system is controlled by the driver's valve.
		The pressure in the brake cylinders is controlled by the pressure difference between two lines -
		the <em>train line</em>, which has a large reservoir and a compressor motor attached, 
		and the <em>brake line</em>, which can be filled from the train line
		or released into the atmosphere as necessary to control the brakes.
		</p>

		<p>
		In typical use, the driver's valve is set to position <var>2</var>.
		This fills the brake line from the train line, which causes the pressure to equalize, and so disengages the brakes.
		Mode <var>4</var> releases the pressure from the brake line into the atmosphere which causes
		the brake cylinders to fill from the train line, thus engaging the brakes.
		In mode <var>3</var>, all the valves are closed, which keeps the brake pressure as it is.
		<var>1</var> is similar to <var>2</var> and <var>5</var> is similar to <var>4</var>,
		except they take effect quicker, and the driver's valve must be held in that position.
		</p>

		<aside class="warning"><p>
		The brake line can become overcharged if the driver's valve is held at position	<var>1</var> for too long.
		</p></aside>

		<p>
		When the electric brakes reach position #18, the pneumatic brakes will be automatically activated.
		When using <var>T2</var> mode, this typically happens at roughly 5-10 km/h.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Reversing direction</h3>

		<p>
		Each head has a <em>reverser</em>, which reverses direction that the train moves in.
		The	reverser has three positions - <var>forward</var>, <var>0</var> and <var>backward</var>.
		The	wagon that you wish to be the front of the train should have its reverser set to <var>forward</var>, all others must be set to <var>backward</var>.
		</p>

	<h2><a id="operations" href="#operations">3. Standard operation</a></h2>

	<section>
		<h3>Starting a train from cold:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Enable the battery banks in each wagon (typically on a switch on the rear wall).</li>
			<li>In the front driver's cabin, set the reverser to <var>forward</var> by pressing <kbd>0</kbd>.</li>
			<li>Engage the driver's valve by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>.</li>
			<li>Disengage the hydraulic brakes by pressing <kbd>R</kbd> until the driver's valve in position 2.</li>
			<li>Wait for brake cylinder pressure to reach 0.</li>
			<li>Start moving by moving the controller to position <var>X2</var> by pressing <kbd>2</kbd>.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Braking to stop:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Enable electric brakes by moving the controller to position <var>T1</var> by pressing <kbd>5</kbd>.</li>
			<li>Gradually increase the braking resistance by switching between <var>T1A</var> (<kbd>6</kbd>) and <var>T1</var> (<kbd>5</kbd>).</li>
			<li>When the train's speed is at roughly 20km/h, switch to <var>T2</var> by pressing <kbd>7</kbd>.</li>
			<li>When the train's speed is at roughly 5-10km/h, the hydraulic brakes should automatically engage.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
		To avoid damage to the engines and discomfort of the passengers, the current through engines is limited.
		The effective acceleration and braking of train is 1.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
		</p>

		<aside class="info"><p>
		The trains use rheostat control for starting and braking (Em, Ema508), thyristor control for braking (81-717, Ema509).
		It takes some time for rheostat to spin into the right position.
		Try to get a good feeling of this delay.

	<h2><a id="technical" href="#technical">4. Technical details</a></h2>

	<section>
		<h3>Electric System</h3>
		<p>
		The train electric circuits are divided into <em>auxiliary</em> circuits, <em>power</em> circuits and <em>control</em> circuits.
		There are four electric engines, two engines in each bogie - connected in series (engines #1 and #3, engines #2 and #4).
		The two pairs of engines can be in turn connected in series or in parallel.
		</p>

		<p>
		Each engine consists of an anchor (a rotor) and a stator.
		All subway trains described in this manual use series excitation of engine.
		This means that current flows through anchor, then flows through stator.
		</p>

		<p>
		Current through stator will create a magnetic field, in which the anchor will rotate.
		The rotation of anchor generates current in opposite of current which accelerates it.
		When current that flows through the engine equals counter-current generated by the engines, the train stops accelerating.
		This is known as <strong>automatic mode</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		During the initial start of the train, there is no magnetic field available and so no counter-current is generated.
		If the engines would be connected in series to the 750 V power source, the total current flowing through them would be (750 V) / (4 * 0.0691 Ω) = 2710 A.
		Such a current would destroy the engines.
		To limit the current flowing through engines during startup a rheostat is used.
		It adds additional resistance to the power circuits, limiting the current to 240-260 A for an empty train,
		and up to 310-340 A on slopes and under load.
		</p>

		<p>
		Acceleration of the train depends on current through the anchor.
		Rotation rate is dependant on current through the stator (which is usually equal to current through the anchor).
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Control System</h3>

		<p>
		When trains are coupled together mechanically, the electric ports located on the coupling are connected too.
		Each of the pins creates a <strong>train wire</strong>, single conductor which is shared by all the wagons of the train.
		Train wires are used to transmit control signals to all of the wagons of the train.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h3>Pneumatic System</h3>

		<p>
		Pressure in brake cylinders is defined by difference of pressure between brake line and train line/reservoir.
		To increase pressure in brake cylinder, brake line pressure must be released.
		</p>

		<p>
		The pneumatic system is shared across all of the trains wagons.
		This is controlled by the <strong>isolation valves</strong>.
		These valves allow connection of brake line and train line through the coupling.
		The isolation valves on both ends of the train should be closed, while all the isolation valves between wagons should be open.
		Closed valves along the train will prevent operation of the pneumatic system across the entire train and will decreased braking efficiency.
